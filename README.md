# Amazon Inventory Ledger Converter

Transform Amazonâ€™s dense Inventory Ledger report into a **clean**, **daily-level dataset** thatâ€™s ready for analysis in Python, Google Sheets, or Excel.

## âœ¨ Why Use This?
Amazonâ€™s Inventory Ledger is a goldmine of insights â€” but its **native format is unwieldy**.
Each dayâ€™s stock movements can be split into multiple rows across all warehouses, making quick analysis difficult.

**This converter**:
Filters to only `SELLABLE` inventory.
Aggregates data to **daily totals per ASIN**.
Keeps only key columns for planning & visualization.
Saves a new `_Grouped.csv` file for easy use.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use
Save your Amazon Inventory Ledger report as a .csv file.

Run the script:
```
python inventory_ledger.py
```

Enter the **full file path** when prompted.
The cleaned, grouped file will be saved in the same folder with `_Grouped.csv` appended to the name.

### ðŸ›  Example Output Columns
|Columns|Meaning|
|:---:|:---:|
|`Date`|Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format|
